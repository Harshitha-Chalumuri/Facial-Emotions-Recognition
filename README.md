# Facial-Emotions-Recognition
A set of images for classifying facial expressions

This repository is a dataset of different facial expressions used for training machine learning algorithms.



**Structure**
There are two directories. The images directory contains raw images. These are unprocessed. The data directory contains files specific to training. Most importantly, this includes the legend.csv, which maps an image in the images directory with a facial expression.

This file also has a user ID field. Please use something unique. It is primarily for tracking which students added which files. The IDs can be used for a secondary analysis to determine whether there are any patterns to the submissions.

**Emotions**
The set of emoions used are TBD
